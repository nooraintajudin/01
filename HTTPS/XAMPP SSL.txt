Guide: Openssl in XAMPP

Prerequisite: There is normally no need to install openssl (it comes bundled with Xampp). Apache 2.4.9 includes 1.0.1g for instance.

openssl folder structure:

In C:\Xampp\bin\apache\apache#.#.#\conf create the following folder structure:

..
demoCA
|-----certs
|-----crl
|-----newcerts
|-----private


Creating the certificate:

set OPENSSL_CONF=C:\xampp\apache\bin\openssl.cnf   


From command line browse to C:\Xampp\bin\apache\apache#.#.#\bin\ 

"openssl req -new -out cacert.csr -keyout cacert.pem". 


If prompted enter a password and after that the DN informations like below.

Loading 'screen' into random state - done
Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
.......................++++++
....++++++
writing new private key to 'cacert.pem'
Enter PEM pass phrase: my_secret_pass
Verifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: my_secret_pass
`-----
You are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated
into your certificate request.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.
There are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank
For some fields there will be a default value,
If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.
`-----
Country Name (2 letter code) []:
State or Province Name (full name) []:
Locality Name (eg, city) []:
Organization Name (eg, company) []:
Organizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:
Common Name (e.g. server FQDN or YOUR name) []:local
Email Address []:

Please enter the following 'extra' attributes
to be sent with your certificate request
A challenge password []:
An optional company name []:

C:\Xampp\bin\apache\apache2.4.9\bin>

In the same console window now use:

 "openssl rsa -in cacert.pem -out cacert.key" 
 
and if asked enter the password previously entered.

Enter pass phrase for cacert.pem: my_secret_pass
writing RSA key

Still in the same window call:

"openssl x509 -in cacert.csr -out cacert.cert -req -signkey cacert.key -days 365". 

 If you experience the following error "unable to write 'random state'". This is a known bug! To workaround this call "set RANDFILE=.rnd" and retry the previous command.

Congrats you are now the owner of a self signed certificate!

Place the built files (they are currently in bin folder) according this Site:

cacert.pem, cacert.key in C:\Xampp\bin\apache\apache#.#.#\conf\demoCA\private
cacert.cert, cacert.csr in C:\Xampp\bin\apache\apache#.#.#\conf\demoCA\certs


Now test your Apache installation by calling "httpd -t"


It will say "Syntax OK


Xampp is now configured with https support
 
You can check now your server status here

https://localhost/server-status/

Copy the .htaccess file to the root of your website.
